This repo contains the vscode snippet (Which I use for CP) and an example of its usage. 
Note: some part of this snippet has been authored by me whereas several part have been taken from other repos.
I would keep updating the snippet to add more functionalities as I learn more stuff!

The setup which I use includes VSCODE + CPH Submit->(vscode and chrome extension)
You can watch this video to fully understand how to use these snippets and be faster in CP - https://youtu.be/9eX2FJhxvzI


Happy coding!

This repo contains the vscode snippet (Which I use for CP) and an example of its usage. 
Note: some part of this snippet has been authored by me whereas several part have been taken from other repos.
I would keep updating the snippet to add more functionalities as I learn more stuff!

The setup which I use includes VSCODE + CPH Submit->(vscode and chrome extension)
You can watch this video to fully understand how to use these snippets and be faster in CP - https://youtu.be/9eX2FJhxvzI


Happy coding!

TODO: the segment tree code can be improved. Do that when you get time. 
=======
[MAJOR UPDATIONS ON 18th Sep, 2023]: Please note the changes if you have been using this already as code such as primesnippets, segment tree might break due to these changes.
Happy coding!
